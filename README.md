## Comments
 I finished the project and the code runs perfectly well
 I made three classes, the Fireworks, Canvas and GUI. (Naming is quite self-explanatory)
 The user is able to select the angle of launch, size of explosion, color and shape of explosion
 The firework is launched when the user clicks on the canvas
 The firework will automatically launch and explode once clicked

## Problems with the code
 Unable to vary the time and length of each launch
 Sloppy animation
 Not really sure whether I implemented the formula correctly or not
